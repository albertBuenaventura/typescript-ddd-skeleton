Domain Driven Design using TypeScript

### Architecture

### Folder Structure

### Use Case Design Pattern

### Dependency Inversion Container
This repository does not use any Inversion of Control(IoC) like Awilix or InversifyJS. Manually injecting classes is still manageable with the help of Use Case Design Pattern.

If it happens that your dependencies are getting out of hand, I recommend that you check out the Awilix or InversifyJS.
